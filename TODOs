================================================================================

* make *everything* parallel (e.g., there are many pairs of operations)
* squaring:
    * for Karatsuba: (A^2 << 2n) + (A*B << n+1) + (B^2)
    * n.b., thresholds for Karatsuba may change
    * for schoolbook:
        * 1-word square .. 1BS
        * other mult's are 2x repeated, only (4 over 2) = 6 actual multiplications needed
        * e.g., for 4-word square, 4 * 1BS + (4 over 2) * 2BS = 16BS instead of 32BS for multiplication

* cfg for max{} behavior
* resolve bootstraps after / before operations

* replace sequential with standard base algorithms
* wish: add tree-based method for arbitrary function evaluation
