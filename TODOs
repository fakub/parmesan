    TODO
================================================================================

* make *everything* parallel (e.g., there are many pairs of operations)
* squaring: divide & conquer: (A^2 << 2n) + (A*B << n+1) + (B^2)
    * multiply |n|n+1|-bit numbers

* cfg for max{} behavior
* resolve bootstraps after / before operations

* replace sequential with standard base algorithms
* wish: add tree-based method for arbitrary function evaluation
