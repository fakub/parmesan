================================================================================

* !! make new estimates on Karatsuba and D&C squaring BS complexity !!
* for squaring of non-power-of-2: multiply |n|n+1|-bit numbers
* make *everything* parallel (e.g., there are many pairs of operations)
    * check whether nested parallel iterators work as expected, i.e., whether they put everything into one pool

* cfg for max{} behavior
* resolve bootstraps after / before operations

* replace sequential with standard base algorithms
* wish: add tree-based method for arbitrary function evaluation
